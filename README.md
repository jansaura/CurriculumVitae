### Information Architecture

I have organized the information on my site to be clear and easy to navigate, allowing visitors to quickly find the most relevant details of my professional profile. The page is divided into key sections like "About Me," "Experience," "Education," "Skills," "Portfolio," and "Contact." This design follows a linear, top-to-bottom format, making it easy for users to intuitively go through each section and view all the content. The sections I consider most important, such as professional experience and skills, are placed near the top to immediately showcase my strengths. Each section has a clear heading to guide readers, and the content is concise, highlighting only the most essential points. My goal with this architecture is for users to gain a quick overview of my profile but also to have the option to explore more details if they wish—like the Portfolio section, which is currently empty but planned for future updates. Contact information is easily accessible. Overall, this structure aims for readability and easy navigation while giving prominence to my profile.

### Visual Design

For the visual design of my CV, I've focused on projecting a professional image and maintaining readability, while incorporating personal branding elements to avoid a dull appearance. I chose a clean and minimalist design that keeps the focus on the content without distracting the visitor. I use a neutral color palette—like gray and white—that provides a professional feel. At the same time, I wanted to keep the page from looking too serious, so I added dynamic touches with orange accents, visible in the profile photo, links, and other subtle details. Typography also plays a key role: I selected a modern, sans-serif font for headings and a classic, readable font for the main text. I also employ ample white space around each section to improve visual flow, allowing users to progress through the content without feeling overwhelmed. Images are kept minimal, limited to a professional profile photo and a few project examples, keeping the main focus on the written content. Overall, this visual approach aims to reflect a polished, modern aesthetic that also supports the credibility of my profile, helping me make a strong first impression.
